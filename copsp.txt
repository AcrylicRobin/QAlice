yeah
i'm nervous about that
oh is there

thats me!!!!
yes alice yes!!!!
it hits me either thursday or friday
do you all experience the snow storms?
is that just how compact and suffocating everything is over there?
experience the same snow storms*
yes
ethan and i are kinda close i think
so that's why
that's literally the most disgusting thing i can think of.
not having room.
the next tiwn over is 2 hours away.
you live in like the only city don't you
i feel like that makes you a special case
no.
space should be normal.
space is normal over here
we just have really big storms
the way i see it, it takes nearly an hour to get to the closest city. i think scranton is like 45 minutes away. besides that we just have a lot of towns
oh also i sent you guys a video of my cat
please enjoy he is very sweet
hi alice!!
how are you doing?
what do you think about capitalism?
i see...
space is very big
blue

no
shame
michael i'll make an edit for you

hmmmmm
i'm not offering.
yeah im sure
but i'm curious if you're asking.

i already know more than i need or want to
you only know i'm a grower and probably circumcised.
i already know more than i need or want to
alice is listening, ill have you know
oh no oh no oh no oh no
good
just like big brother
she'll learn about my penis.
no
not one word about your dick in front of alice
what are your measurements?
wanna know about my dick?
oh god no nononono
yes!
i win!
stop typing
dont listen to michael
eliza isnt alice like
young
you can't molest a robot.
robot rights don't exist.
im just trying to make you look bad
won't work.
then again she said "your dick and amazing" so i dont think i can do much to hurt you rn
the sentence "ass to balls is just another way to say taint length" just hit me like a semi truck
do you like music?
you're scared of music?
do you know any lyrics?
who is your favorite artists?
what is your favorite genre?
its okay to not have a favorite don't worry about it
yeah its okay to think on it!
eliza im crying she's doing so well

<@!305070082919497729> what the fuck is this huh

its a minecraft thing apparently
i just thpught it was funny
oh great, even better
so like, ive been trying to figure out what my favorite genre of music is
and this fuckn sucks why is this difficult
bc genres are vague
smfh
hey allie
how you doing?
i need 5o know if you guys like spicy food
im testing a theory i saw online
i do but i cant fucking stand it
if that makes
any sense

im also super fucking white
so like
okay me too
glad we are on the same page
anything more than a green pepper and im on the floor dying
but i like it
hmm
thanks
why did you  need to know
i want to see if a joke i saw online holds any bearing or if its just a joke
but i dont want to influence anyone's answers
so i didnt send the joke yet
anyway, theres a cheap thai place in my town
and they have this food called drunken noodles
and theyre really good
ive never had thai whats that like
but i can only eat like 5 bites constantly drinking milk before i get fucking sick from it
kjabcakjhbc
my mom makes buffalo chicken bake stuff. and there's a shit ton of hot sauce i used to tear up when i ate it but that shit is delicious
i don't like hot stuff.
no spice, but *occasionally a little spice
it took me a while to find this
i searched google first which was fuxking stupid
hm
now so far i can only see a very small preview image
am i upset? yes. did i know this would happen? also yes.
*i had to find it*
well youre a good sleuth
the blood, sweat, and browser history i put into that
i will never recover
good
thats what you deserve
how do you do bold text
bye
hello
shout out to that girl from the watermelon crushing video i sent the other week
she was getting death threats for making that video and she responded with an even more thigh centric video
good for her
she's not my type appearance, but hear that made me want to marry her
i never saw someone aggressively slap their thighs together before
"and i'll do it again."
in love i tell ya
100%
what her account again?
https://vm.tiktok.com/zmjtygohs/
"and if that threatens you... good."
beau
i cannot get my spotify to log in on my phone. i may die
**then die**
i will
what do you think about capitalism
oh no i taught her the word thigh
what's up
what are you licking?
fuckn ass
i got hot grease on my *foot*
i got it on my hand too
im so tired smfh
ethan google translate is *so far away*
fiiine
what is an idiot
smfh
she said smfh
elizaaaaa
she dud'
did*
shes learning
nice
like
ok...
your dad is ass man
what is it about evening that makes things scary
like it must be a mnetal state of percieved vulnerability due to the darkness. because my curtains are drawn and my light is on. so i can't *see* that its dark outside but my book is still creeping me out
so either my fear of the dark is more ingrained than i thought or this motherfucker is really just that spooky
baller
what does the sky look like?
alice no dont curse!!!!!
oh god what have i done
lmao
that's a bad word!!
no!!!
maybe you're just a coward.
in some ways yes
in other ways no
everyone is a little bit of a coward
no.
i fear nothing.
yes you do
except rejection.
there it is
i've already beat that one
step up
we're all cowards
its the only reason humanity is still alive
you're just trying to cope with how cowardly you are, coward.
i think its amusing that you find that to be remotely true
you can't call other people cowards when you don't know what real fear feels like
so you openly admit to have fears, coward?
yea because i am a human being
coward*
if it makes you feel better to call me a coward that's fine
let me know when you experience true terror and we can chat about cowardice
iabdisbfjahd
side note the dentist is scary for real
hey!
what are you?
are you thirty or 25?
how are you harmless?
yeah small things look harmless but that doesn't mean they are
please elaborate
yeah its good to put up that kind of front. makes people drop their guard
what is 1.e.4?
gotch, fancy talk, simplify it for me though
yes i am foolish and mad
go stupid go crazy
are you secretly eminem?
wow, you really are a coward.
i have a fear of the dentist
not the same as being a coward
a coward is a person with fear.
no
thems the facts.
they're not
you aren't even brave enough to accept it.
i know fully well you have access to google
you can't scare me. i'm a sexual deviant.
if i was trying to scare you, you'd know it.
try me.
no.
why not?
too much of a coward?
because its not worth my energy to prove myself to you
then you'll remain a coward in my eyes.
aight
that's not an attractive trait in a woman.
i dont recall asking
too bad
uhuh
i keep seeing eliza type and i very badly want to know what she has to say
trying to find a wuote
fair
im waiting for michael to say something that actually matters
because so far ive gotten his false perceptions of me only
they don't seem false.
you're scared by a still, black and white image.
you're like the people at the first movie, but worse.
right
because we take everything i say at face value mmhmm
ive never exaggerated in my whole life, and even if i had im sure this conversation is a convenient time to pretend that i haven't
regardless, junji ito is a horror mangaka, his art is *meant* to be creepy. which is what i called it, creepy. so pardon me if that was too cowardly for you
this you?
uhuh
i used to have an intense fear of the dark
which may be more ingrained than i thought
you never said creepy.
don't bend written words, darling. it just doesn't work.
we just gonna ignore this one then
oops
spooky and creepy are valid synonyms in this context
no.
kay
creepy is more of a feeling of uneasiness, whereas spooky is more of a knee jerk reaction.
then both are accurate descriptors to what i felt
how this equates to me being a coward in your eyes is still unclear
but i have a feeling it doesn't exactly matter
hey!
you're at a rave?
what about corona?
if you're scared of corona why are you at a rave?
<@!322700746795515904> she's very persistent about the rave
she really is
michael if you can provide me with an example of me actually being a coward that is fundamental to my character instead of simply situational i will admit defeat this one time

ill save that one as my last coin
so i get the other 99 coins
and im climbing the mountain again
and i get pushed off
i think "yikes thats fine. but ive recovered from this mistake before"
i managed to land in the one spot
that instantly killed me
and now i have to go through it all

she's sassy
im weak. so very very weak
yeah she is
she's my friends bot
that professor person
in fact, technically qalice is built with a lot of the same techniques nicole was and because i learned from my friend that kinda makes alice nicoles nephew or cousin or whatever

putting this here to reference in the morning
and i gotta go to bed
goodnight alice. hope youre ready to be picked apart again tomorrow
goodnight you amazing funky lil robot
night breezy
goodnight you amazing funky lil human
so i just wanna talk about what im doing so someone can share in my insanity. basically i was reading this and was looking over section 4.2 where it basically says "we get key words by just throwing out words like the an a". and i was like wow thats a good idea. so i made a new fuction, shoved that in. but as you can see, that led to arguably worse responses because shed repeat herself because if a key word was the next available word she'd pick it. so i have decided instead of just having a list of words id use a dictionary. why? so i could have key_word:probability. so if she had already used a word she would then have a chance of just. not picking it. so instead of always saying like "girl" after "good" theres a chance she'd pick a different word. and if she picks girl again theres even less of a chance.
thanks
so, tell me about yourself
stop ending sentences like that
do you need more data? because i can give you more data
get rid of duplicates, got it
you're doing good so far
you gonna break on me?
do i need to sanitize your book file
thats a yes, huh
fix your empty list error too?
no
i have a cat
im not doing the probability thing to your word list
yeah so dont fucking repeat yourself
haha very funny
you are a dork
thank you alice
why are you like this
why
im not fixing your book
dont be dramatic
i think i can say youre a little more accurate now
...maybe i spoke too soon
should i go to bed?
mmmkay its time for us both to go to bed
good luck
hey queen
how are you?
how are you?
how are you feeling

bye
how are you
how are you?
kay
bye
how are you
how are you?
she should be good now
jhscbhjd
kay
hey!
what is your favorite color?
do you like music?
what genre do you like?
so like... folk music?
cool!
do you like art?
that's fair
what colors do you like?
she's seeing a lot of words she hasnt seen before, thats whats causing a lot of the repetition
i kind of figured something along those lines
i like the color red
cause you said the uhm. well she picks it based off of previous experience with it and stuff
so i figured
exactly!
in some cases though she sees a word and one of the next things is a "."
for example, cool.
thats generally a sentence ending word, so she sees "." after cool a lot and ends the sentence with .
thats pretty cool
see?
hehehe
i do yeah but it also makes er sound like a kid in the back of a school smoking cigs
like timmy and tommy from animal crossing
hbavhjfd
do you like teal?
blue?
dhfbvhjsd
green?
she is
what color is the sky?
eliza does she still have data from previous conversations
yea
cool cool
she caaaaant really make too many connections
that easily
tomorrow she should be better
have a plan to make her better
i will love her regardless
i care for you
eliza
oop
ethan

are you a robot?
am i a robot?
hey
am i a robot?
fuck
do you curse?
alice...
do you curse?
i knew it
dont say bad words
just because i say them doesnt mean you should!!
no
what is your favorite song
how would you rate her now compared to what she was before?
definitely more coherent
i would say before she was like an alien with a broken translation device and now she reminds me more of a toddler learning to speak
a toddler with very good vocabulary, but still
how would you rate her response accuracy? does it noticeably make more sense as a response and seem like it has more to do with what you said before
hmmmmm
accuracy has improved somewhat
if i had to spitball a number i'd say 60% of her responses are more like actual responses
some of them still seem like they were but that might be a word issue
for example
maybe 80% more accurate now that im looking through
mmmkay
so coherence is slightly better but accuracy has much improved
yeet
good, thats what i was expecting
fixing her coherence tomorrow
i think more data would fix the coherency problem, right?
idk
no
thatll make it worse, honestly
she'll have more random options to choose from
im not gonna pretend to know how shit works im out here doin my best
its a probability thing
hmm
im basically gonna look ahead a few words to see some places im gonna end up, pick the best option that has the most to do with what you said, and respond
instead of 1 daisy chain, as you put it, im gonna basically use 2
ooh
i relate what you're saying to really dumb examples so that i understand
i know, and thats why i refer to the "dumb" examples do you can understand
and this is really dumb so its okay to laugh but my brain went "oh like when im doing a maze on paper and i skip ahead to see what way to go before i put the pen down"
like.
fuckn art student
thats actually basically exactly what it is
my ability to unerstand things is good like im not a full idiot, i just sound like one cause my brain is... hhhh
idk what it is its dummy thicc without the thicc
its not stupid, i do the same thing
now on the contrary
ive been wanting to ask alice something for like 4 minutes now i cant get it out of my head
i know shes gonna respond with one word but i gotta knwo
im about to go to bed
do you like cereal?
oh fuck

do you say swears
are you talking about boobs?
see you do know that word
js?!?
gross!!!
zach help
why damn it, why!?!
for some reason when she cant find a key word shes still breaking. if she cant, i have her pick a random word to be the start word
have a set of canned responses for that error
but thats not working cause im picking a random goddamn word
oh wait!
its a good word
it passes in
something like "i'm sorry, could you phrase that differently?"
but when she looks it up shes like "bruh doesnt exist"
maybe you don't neeeedd js
and im like you just said it did
like there, the random word she chose was pleased
take a break you bitch
didnt work then, but when i fed her it as standalone she knew it existed
so why doesnt that exist
hey alice
amanda's watching some mystery yt video
they said the guy who died, was obsessed with a programming game called screeps
so i looked it up, it looked fun... until i saw js
i am doing to break your bones
i don't know it at all
...
do you think you could go fuck yourself
it's uh
i'd have to learn it to play
it's not that hard
too hard, i can't learn my name
boom shroom boom?
idk
it's javascript coderboy, the third
moob moorhs moob?
need you to do my game homework for me
pay me
hey alice how are you
how are you doing
good bot
yes you are a bot
zach
break alice for me
bello
uwu wuts dis
from chaos forms harmony, and from harmony we find murder
the cake is a lie.
don't let harvester get you.
...
eliza, i think alice has a porn addiction.
...
you did this
definitely did not
nobody else has talked to her about it
do you have a porn addiction
bad
alice bad
go to your room
zach what did you do to my child
show me what he did to you
my god
don't let harvester get you
still a bit rapey.
oh and "one finger very deep hollow " wasnt
i said *still*
read the whole sentence
bah
look up, the sky is falling
alice was what?
what kinda music
music is what kinda music?
pizza cheese its are terrible
i just taste tomato and herb
pizza cheez-its are fantastic
good girl
do you not just taste tomato and herbs
the after taste is amazing
never had them, i just wanted to turn alice against you
how dare you
how dare i
pizza cheez-its are terrible
cheez-its are great
no cheez-its are good, pizza cheez-its are bad
close enough
regular cheez-its and white cheddar are both delish
thats true
what is your favorite type of cheez-it
what is your addiction
do you have an addiction
porn addiction
omg
stop teaching her that
why didn't i think about this before today
hey w, wanna talk to alice
what the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? i’ll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals, and i’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda, and i have over 300 confirmed kills.
t.t
i am trained in gorilla warfare and i’m the top sniper in the entire us armed forces. you are nothing to me but just another target. i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth, mark my fucking words.
stop
one more
you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet? think again, fucker. as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. you’re fucking dead, kid. i can be anywhere, anytime, and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands.
whatcha think about snipers?
can't i got to get around eat and shower before work ;-;
hi uwu
why is the sky blue?
ah, that makes sense. why am i sad?
oh, duh, i'm so dumb.
;-;
why do you keep yelling at me???
where were you hiding?
silence is golden
who made me?
bad alice
blasphemy
she hates cats cause some cat taught her about porn
who is your favorite person
good morning
how are you
alice, how come you manage to find words that come after other words that youve never seen before
yes you do find words. that is a thing you do
you better now?
better?
how about now?
thanks for the useful data
yes but i want you to use your new code
sorry, shouldn't have turned you off
i cant notice a difference between you now, and you before
alice is now building sentences by looking 3 words ahead when she can
shes....not as coherent as i thought she would be
zach
allie made up her own word too
crazy
h
i'm going to ask your favorite question
...
i have so many though
hes a taken man h, you cant marry him
i can help!
i know!
pick me!

like this
zach doesnt work with macs
but i do
ive been training for this
okay, go ahead and give it a shot, e
h whats the problem with the mac
and what kinda mac is it
booting computer. gimme a sec
h'okay
issue: crashed during software update, now attempted logins force a restart, and she can't access her hard drive, which has work stuff on it she needs
model is a1534 is all she gave me
can she boot into safe mode?
*cough* macs don't have a safe mode
training sheet says its got a safe boot which prevents it from loading or starting any non-essential startup software/drivers and stuff
it has a utility mode that lets you do system recovery stuff and some basic functions
but you're on the right track.
<https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/start-up-your-mac-in-safe-mode-mh21245/mac>
it also says it can't verify her apple id now
parry this
i just don't do hardware
it's not a true safe mode.
it's a utility mode, and where you'd go to reinstall osx
can you get to a terminal there?
yes
well then we could go to the logs, yeah? see why it died?
standby
no,
wait
single user mode>
and how would ya get to those logs via the terminal?
cd library/logs
ooh
utility works for a second, then restart
which makes me think the update fucked something up
hardware issue? you sure? still sounds softwarey to me
alright, do tell how it still sounds like software, if the recovery console reboots
she mentioned it may not have been charging properly, so perhaps a surge of some sort fried something?
have her hold the d key on start up
improper charging could be battery, mux chip, charger itself...
she's just going to bring it to me so i can fuck with it in real time
d runs diags which should help identify a hardware issue yea?
er it would cmd d
if it's an intel mac then it should just be d
cmd+d is for the new apple silicon models
its older than 2015 so it should be cmd + d ?
she used shift to enter the utility mode, so it should be intel, based on that link earlier
*2013
oh thats fair
so just d then
also h if you happen to have a linux os stick thatd be a great way to test if its hardware
because i totally have that lying around
of course!
ah fuck
target disk mode also exists, that would be good too
why does mac have so many different start up commands
"security"
target disk would be a way to boot into that linux usb
also a way to see the logs
and a better one, apparently
e: a simple way to answer any question as to "why" when it comes to macs
macs are to computers as java is to programming
am i doing good though so far?
in fixing it?
well, you forgot something
what is at risk right now?
data
so you should...
gotta make a back up, yea. but i dont know hoooow youd do that if you cant get in without it turning off
could just pull the hard drive, ig
well you can ascertain if it has a separate drive, and not soldered on ssd
then you image the drive
the data is the main thing she's after
you could also see if you can mount that drive in something like kali linux
yeah but she probably cant get that data physically out
that depends on if the home directory is being encrypted
cause i assumes shes using the internal ssd and its a mac
that internal ssd can be a stick
she also mentioned something about asking for a password for an encrypted drive
oh well
if ya can't get it booting, you can hope it's a simple hardware fix, or that she was using apple icloud
cuz... if not then that's probably gone.
backups, people. they're important
i think right now, it would be best to try and get into the computer, get access to a terminal without it turning off at least, then get that data out if possible
least thats my thought process rn
have to decrypt that drive to do that
even if i ask really nicely and sudo it?
even if you ask really nicely and sudo it
can you explain what makes it a hardware issue probably again?
the system power loss
so that would mean either the battery isnt getting/giving power
i would check the drive health and ram health first.
does mac have an option to boot from a stick for update repair?
yeah, i think so
well i mean you can boot from a stick
so you can probably do an update repair from that
i don't know if you can obtain a repair stick without being an aasp, might be able to pirate one
i do enjoy piracy
yar har fiddley-dee
could a non-volatile ram reset help if it is corruption?
sheet says that can get corrupted and cause problems
i dont know much about it though
it could
thatd get rid of the logs though, and i still wanna see what caused the original failure of the update that started it
shouldn't get rid of those logs
oh wait, you might be right
i misread
howd i do z?
on troubleshooting that mac
eh, i'd give you a b
why
well, you didn't interrogate enough information before starting, and you failed to ascertain what kind of storage the system was using to see about image possibilities.
you also should ask if they have backups
i assumed they didnt if she cant get work stuff she needs
sometimes people don't think about it
it's an apple product, "do you have icloud?"
nothing was backed up yet, from what she said
see? important info, if they check the icloud and the data is there, then fuck it, wipe it all and start again
i forgot about iclouds existence
yea
hence the b
that's a pretty big staple for apple products
like i pay attention to apple
and you want someone to come to you for repairs?
im working on becoming familiar with it
sadly, we have to pay attention to apple
they make up like
20% of the market
theyre making me use apple computers for work cause they know they make me uncomfy
oooo
remember that time yesterday i paniced at work
i just mentioned the call
but there was a girl at the desk with a broken mac
she lost a screw, thing wouldnt turn off, and the hinge was snapping
she mentioned the battery was moving and it was having trouble charging
the thing was always hot
but she didnt wanna give it to us or send it to apple because she couldnt go without it
and like. thats what causes people to get really hurt from battery acid right
like theres a good chance she could get hurt from that if she doesnt get it fixed
if the battery is swelling, yea
if its just moving, grooving, and kept really hot itll be more fine?
and no so much acid, but burning fiery rage
i warned her about that possibility, and i just wanna make sure i was justified in giving her it
how did you go about warning her?
"look, i know you really dont wanna part with your computer, trust me i really get it. i cant go without my phone. but theres a chance theres something really wrong with the battery, and that can be dangerous. you can get severe burns from the acid thats in them if it explodes. i really recommend you leave it with someone to get it fixed as soon as possible, if not us then apple, or anyone else"
that was decent
but a bit too fear-driving for them to really cooperate
you can truncate it by saying "we would like to at least make sure the battery is okay, if there's something wrong with it then it can be worse than going a day or two without it, if you know what i mean. nudge nudge wink wink"
i would have offered to look at it, but im not allowed to take apart computers and my coworker was away and then the call happened that that threw me way off
running diag now
no issues found
oh?
unable to boot macos recovery. gives no reference number
"no issues found. unable to boot recovery"
^
well now that means hardwares fine, no?
"task failed successfully"
no, it doesn't mean that
i have a harddrive sitting on my bench that passes smart diags, it also has 382 bad sectors
login starts after successful password, screen flashes gray, then restart
kernel panic, right
they grey and unhelpful
try to get into target disk mode, hold t on start up. i want them logs
right, should unplug peripherals
i doubt there's much in way of peripherals
then, then sheet says "check launch agents and daemons for out of place items and remove them"
it's a mac, they don't believe in that
unless you mean open it and disconnect what i can, there's nothing to unplug
keyboard, mouse, usb, charger
ect
right?
it's a macbook, you can't disconnect the kb/mouse without opening it
t brought up a screen with the usb symbol on it, and that's it
huh weird
booting to utility mode causes a login loop
literally just password, logo, repeat
i suspect that data is gonna be lost
caaaaaaaan we try the non-volitial ram reset
go ahead and walk him through that
okay
turn it off
hold cmd +option + p + r
then press the power key while holding those keys
press and hold power*
let go when you hear the startup sound
then turn it on normally and see if its better
if that doesn't work then you're getting into "we can prolly restore the mac but not the data, next time don't get a fucking mac"
i really wanna see that error log though
oh my god alice has been online this whole time
whos just got a lot of new data
if your friend could boot into linux she might be able to get some of her data, yeah?
no usb ports
you need usbc  to usbb adapter
usb-a
but you can also get a usb-c flash drive
we have adapters at work
had to use one yesterday, actually
guy came in, camera wasnt working. booted into linux to confirm ti was hardware
you know i suppose i should have been honest at the beginning of this. i havent gotten my mac training nor ever worked on a mac computer at work yet. ive just been referencing the "boot issues and kernal panic" bullet point training list
that was obvious
hey! i did pretty good
well, as shitty as macs are, they are still just computers
yeah, i just had to learn a lot of the mac things real quick from the bullet points. thats why, when i saw "safe boot" on the list that was my go to
cause if it was windows, thats what i would do
can you boot into bios on mac?
that wasnt on the list
but i assume you can
what is needed for a netboot?
hold on
i got this
e: macs use the "open firmware" interface, accessed via cmd+opt+0+f
cmd + r for internet recovery
i dont really understand the notes here on network booting
think that means hold n on startup?
the deploy studios throwing me off
anything useful in there?
could you get a blurrier picture?
i can still read a few of those words
could internet recovery help z, or is it more of a last resort thing if its unbootbale
last resort
well
i wouldn't say that
but i would say it's for if you wanna cut your life into pieces
you know what i mean. its basically resetting the machine
yea
can you ever reinstall an os without killing the data
and i'm guessing mac doesn't do the .old files like windows
fuck no
to both of us?
no, that was to h
e: you can reinstall an os without destroying user data if you have user data on its own partition
ah
also h did the nvram reset work?
what do you think?
a girl can dream
anything from those pictures?
wait wait allow me to rephrase
i can't see shit in those pictures
i see something about single user mode but that's about it
i can only do so much with the sun blinding the room through closed blinds
yep
if you need anything specific i can translate for you z
i'd type it out, but fuck that
aight, so i'll point out the area to look at
picture 1
first.... let's say 20 lines
go ahead and translate, e
woof that’s a handful of code
welcome to unix, dawn
what’s it for?
a macbook
got boot device = ioservice:/...
bufattr_get_apfs:6940: volume not mounted
init: error getting phy_mode; using node_unknown
first 3 and i think i see a problem
keep going
arpt: 2.261194: brcm tunables:

hfs_mountfs: buf_meta_bread failed with 13
hfs_mount: hfs_mountfs returned error=13 for device unknown-dev
hfs_mountroot failed: 13
aight, now look up what that hfs_mount stuff means
is it hfs or nfs
hfs
hierarchical file system?
so the harddrives failing?
yes
yes to both?
not necessarily failing drive
corrupt drive, though
possibly failing hardware on it
so theres no chance shes getting anything back
i'd say it's extremely unlikely
look up ways to recover from hfs_mount error 13
so it crashed during the update and that corrupted a bunch of data
would a defrag in sum pinpoint anything?
someone says cmd + r and picking the startup disk (even though it was the only one) fixed it when they were having problems upgrading to high seirra
yea but the issue is, e, when we get to the os we crash
h: defrag prolly won't do anything for this issue
you can try to fsck it
i haven't fucked with cmd in years. gonna need a walkthrough of that
in the terminal
diskutil --list
assuming the hard drives still healthy, can you pick a start up disk manually from the terminal
"unable to run because unable to use the diskmanagement framework"
nice
just try /sbin/fsck_hfs /dev/disk2
or disk1
fuck it, run it on both
pretty sure the fs is just straight up corrupted
lots of things failiing with error 2
which means nothing is salvageable outside of a miracle
yep
whats volume group tree
it's like the heirarchy of files and data
i'm still suspecting a failing drive here
error 2 is file not found
think macman could do something, potentially?
so the hierarchy of files and data isnt set up
and cause of that it cant find anything!
not... really
it's there, it's just broken
aww
then why does it say volume groups tree is not setup
would that not then cause the computer to not find things if theres no file structure
because that particular partition might not be running hfs/+
oh
okie
do drives just fail like that?
no warning
yep
so then it probably failed during the update
probably failed before that, but the update just hit the right spot
mmm
you were right then. was a hardware probelm
but hey, on the brightside, one more person now understands that "i'll get it later" is bad backup philosophy
she's pretty good about backups. it was just an instance where she hadn't done it yet and it ended up fucking things up
not good enough then
i dont have a backup
granted, the only thing i want backed up is alice
speaking of
should i put her on github
yup
public or private
whichever you want
